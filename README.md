The repository aims to document monte carlo estimations for various models that I have worked on in my PhD. I plan to cover:
1. logit
2. discrete choice model (BLP)
3. dynamic discrete choice model (Gowrisankaran & Rysman 2012)
4. dynamic discrete choice model (Rust)
5. State Dependence Model 
6. Some Bayesian
